Mod 1: The DOM Based Game
If you build a story:
1. Must have two Classes and one instance of each class
    * Example: make a Dog Class and create a Dog named Sam
    * Example: make a Person Class and create a Person named John
2. Story must be controlled by buttons
3. Must use Flexbox
4. Must have a reset button
If you build a you Game must have:
1. Must be a two player game (either against the computer or against another player) - Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer - Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns  
2. A win state - a way for the player to win the game
    * High score can be considered a win state  
3. A lose state - a way for the player to lose the game
    * Example: Blackjack - a player must be able to lose all of their money with losing hands and cannot play if their bankroll is at 0
    * Example: Connect Four - the other player has won or there are no possible plays left  
4. A way to keep playing if the game is not over  
5. Multiple rounds to play - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost - Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll - Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case 

Approach & Troubleshooting: 
I wanted to create a game of the Korean version of rock paper scissors. For now, I just created a simple rock paper scissors game versus the computer labeled “cpu” and the user labeled as “player”. I ran into difficulties with understanding the syntax of javascript and the time constraint but I understand more with the amount of times I started over. I also realized I had uploaded to GitHub incorrectly and had to correct and properly upload to a separate repository.

Stretch Goals: I plan on updating this when I have more time to include the stretch goals. I want to develop this to further include the other two versions of Korean rock paper scissors, see the rules here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2iPthJg8Ew. There were many things I was close to including but didn’t end up working so I commented them out.
